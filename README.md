# solving of python task

I have found the website that has many questions for  improving the Algorithms skill.
Its [projecteuler](https://projecteuler.net)


## solutions 

`1) If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.`[solution](https://github.com/marzieraee/projecteuler/blob/master/solution1.py)


`2) 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
